## Upload & Explore

Upload & Explore are essential and important parts of the OpenBudgets platform, as here budget and spending data is imported, visualised, and analysed. You may choose to upload your own dataset using the ‘Upload’ button, or you can dive straight into the existing datasets by clicking ‘Explore’. 

**Explore**

The explore view shows you the datasets that have been already uploaded to the platform. Selecting ‘view’ will open the OpenBudgets Viewer, with instant access to a series of single-click visualisations that you can customise and embed. ‘Analyse’ will open the suite of data mining algorithms you can run on the dataset, allowing for more advanced insights into your data.

**Upload**

Clicking on ‘Upload’ offers two ways to transfer data into the platform: LinkedPipes and OpenSpending Packager.

To upload a dataset you have on your harddrive, choose **OpenSpending Packager** and follow the instructions on the next page to upload and describe your dataset. **LinkedPipes** is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool primarily targeted at advanced users and domain experts that allows users to create individual pipelines for specific use cases in which data needs to be sourced, e.g. from a URL.

## KPI (Key Performance Indicators)

KPI allows cities and public administrations to publish and compare data using indicators such as investments, subsidies, and taxation per resident.

The detailed display of the information allows for a significantly improved understanding of a city's’ financial health, its income and expenses, as well as many other aspects that otherwise are difficult to discern without extensive research. A city will thereby become more accessible and transparent to its inhabitants through unprecedented openness.

It provides public officers with the instruments to gather and effectively manage user feedback, enabling a greater degree of citizen involvement, engagement and participation in the budget decision-making and implementation processes. Public administrators can, among other tasks, create different proposals and categories, or add several tags to better identify proposals., you can let your electorate become decision makers in the budgeting process. A demo of the tool showing its functionality is available. Contact [Civio](mailto:amir@civio.es) for further details.
